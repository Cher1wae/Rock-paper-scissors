## 🧠 How the Game Works

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple 3-move game:

* **Rock beats Scissors**
* **Paper beats Rock**
* **Scissors beats Paper**

When the user clicks a button:

1. Capture the user's choice
2. Randomly generate the computer's choice
3. Compare both using game rules
4. Display who won (or if it’s a draw)

## 📜 JavaScript Logic Summary

### **Computer Move**

A random value is selected from `["rock", "paper", "scissors"]`.

### **Determine Winner**

The game checks:

* If both choices match → **Draw**
* If user’s choice beats computer’s choice → **User Wins**
* Otherwise → **Computer Wins**
